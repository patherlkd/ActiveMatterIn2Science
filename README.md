## How to use this repository

### Running the examples

1. Click on the Launch Binder button at the top of this README.

2. Wait for the remote server to build the repo *(can take a few moments)*, which will start a new window with the remote jupyter notebook directory.

3. Click `Cell` and then `Run All` (Unless other running instructions specified).

Notes: Different cells take time to run, if on the left side of the notebook you see ``In[]`` (empty) it has not run yet. If you see ``In[*]`` it is currently running. If you see ``In[<number>]`` it has been executed (number relates to the order of its execution e.g. <number> = 1st to tun).
