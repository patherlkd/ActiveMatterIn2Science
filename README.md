## How to use this repository

### Running the interactive simulation

1. Click on the Launch Binder button at the top of this README.

2. Wait for the remote server to build the repo *(can take a few moments)*, which will start a new window with the remote jupyter notebook directory.

3. Click `Run` at the top left and then `Run All Cells` (Unless other running instructions specified).

4. Scroll down to the last cell and run it as per instructions. Click the ``Run Interact`` button to run a simulation.

Notes: Different cells take time to run, if on the left side of the notebook you see ``In[]`` (empty) it has not run yet. If you see ``In[*]`` it is currently running. If you see ``In[<number>]`` it has been executed (number relates to the order of its execution e.g. <number> = 1st to tun).

  5. Play with the sliders:
